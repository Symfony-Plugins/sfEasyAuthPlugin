sfEasyAuth plugin
=================

The `sfEasyAuthPlugin` is a symfony plugin that provides simple authentication
and authorisation. Built for high-performance environments, it only creates two 
database tables, and supports multiple types of users through inheritance. This 
significantly reduces the database overhead compared to sfGuardPlugin by allowing 
default credentials to be assigned, e.g. 
  
  an `admin` type user will automatically acquire the `admin` credential upon logging in.
   
On a site with thousands of users this could represent a big efficiency, both in terms
of execution speed and database storage savings.

This plugin supports users having multiple credentials, brute force protection (with
configurable attempt and lock-out thresholds), user profiles and a remember me feature. 

Installation
------------

  * Install the plugin

        $ symfony plugin:install sfEasyAuthPlugin

  * Rebuild your model

        $ symfony propel:build-model
        $ symfony propel:build-sql
        $ symfony propel:build-forms
        $ symfony propel:build-filters

  * Update your database tables by starting from scratch (it will delete all
    the existing tables, then re-create them):

        $ symfony propel:insert-sql

    or you can just create the new tables by using the generated SQL
    statements in `data/sql/plugins.sfEasyAuth.lib.model.schema.sql`

  * Enable one or more modules in your `settings.yml` (optional)
    * For your backend application:  sfEasyAuth, sfEasyAuthUser
    * For your frontend application: sfEasyAuth

            [php]
            all:
              .settings:
                enabled_modules:      [default, sfEasyAuth]

  * Add the following to your `config/filters.yml` file between `security` and `cache`
  
            [yml]
            sf_easy_auth_auto_login:
              class: sfEasyAuthAutoLogin
            

  * Clear your cache

        $ symfony cc

  * Optionally create a default user (the user type is case sensitive):

        $ symfony easyAuth:create-user al 5ecret1 al@example.com basicUser

  * Optionally create a default admin user:

        $ symfony easyAuth:create-user ally 5ecret2 ally@example.com admin

Secure your application
-----------------------

To secure a symfony application:

  * Enable the module `sfEasyAuth` in `settings.yml`

        [yml]
        all:
          .settings:
            enabled_modules: [..., sfEasyAuth, sfEasyAuthUser]

  * Change the default login and secure modules in `settings.yml`

        [yml]
        login_module:           sfEasyAuth
        login_action:           login

        secure_module:          sfEasyAuth
        secure_action:          secure

  * Change the parent class in `myUser.class.php`

        [php]
        class myUser extends sfEasyAuthSecurityUser
        {
        }

  * Optionally add the following routing rules to `routing.yml`

        [yml]
        sf_easy_auth_login:
          url:   /login
          param: { module: sfEasyAuth, action: login }

        sf_easy_auth_logout:
          url:   /logout
          param: { module: sfEasyAuth, action: logout }

#        sf_guard_password:
#          url:   /request_password
#          param: { module: sfEasyAuth, action: password }

  You can customize the `url` parameter of each route.
  N.B.: You must have a `@homepage` routing rule (used when a user sign out)

  These routes are automatically registered by the plugin if the module `sfEasyAuth`
  is enabled unless you defined `sf_easy_auth_plugin_routes_register` to false
  in the `app.yml` configuration file:

        [yml]
        all:
          sf_easy_auth_plugin:
            routes_register: false

  * Secure some modules or your entire application in `security.yml`

        [yml]
        default:
          is_secure: on

  * You're done. Now, if you try to access a secure page, you will be redirected
    to the login page.
    
  * Once you're logged in, if you try to access a page that requires further credentials
    you'll be prompted to enter another user name and password. 
    
Manage your users
-----------------

To be able to manage your users, `sfEasyAuthPlugin` comes
with a module that can be integrated in your backend application.
This module is auto-generated thanks to the symfony admin generator.

  * Follow the instructions in the 'Secure your application' section, but edit files
    in your back-end application.
    
  * Edit your `security.yml` file as follows:
  
        [yml]
        default:
          is_secure: on
          credentials: admin

  * Access the module with the default route:

        http://www.example.com/backend.php/sfEasyAuthUser

Customize sfEasyAuth module templates
--------------------------------------

By default, `sfEasyAuth` module comes with 2 very simple templates:

  * `loginSuccess.php`
  * `secureSuccess.php`

If you want to customize one of these templates:

  * Create a `sfEasyAuth` module in your application (don't use the
    `init-module` task, just create a `sfEasyAuth` directory)

  * Create a template with the name of the template you want to customize in
    the `sfEasyAuth/templates` directory

  * symfony now renders your template instead of the default one

Customize `sfEasyAuth` module actions
--------------------------------------

If you want to customize or add methods to the sfEasyAuth:

  * Create an `sfEasyAuth` module in your application

  * Create an `actions.class.php` file in your `actions` directory that inherit
    from `BasesfEasyAuthActions` (don't forget to include the `BasesfEasyAuthActions`
    as it can't be autoloaded by symfony)

        [php]
        <?php

        require_once(sfConfig::get('sf_plugins_dir').'/sfEasyAuthPlugin/modules/sfEasyAuth/lib/BasesfEasyAuthActions.class.php');

        class sfEasyAuthActions extends BasesfEasyAuthActions
        {
          public function executeNewAction()
          {
            return $this->renderText('This is a new sfEasyAuth action.');
          }
        }

`sfEasyAuthSecurityUser` class
---------------------------

This class inherits from the `sfBasicSecurityUser` class from symfony and is
used for the `user` object in your symfony application.
(because you changed the `myUser` base class earlier)

So, to access it, you can use the standard `$this->getUser()` in your actions
or `$sf_user` in your templates.

`sfEasyAuthSecurityUser` adds some methods:

  * `logIn()` and `logOut()` methods
  * `getAuthUser()` that returns the `sfEasyAuthUser` object

For example, to get the current username:

    [php]
    $this->getUser()->getAuthUser()->getUsername()

    // or via the proxy method
    $this->getUser()->getUsername()

Check the user password with an external method
-----------------------------------------------

If you don't want to store the password in the database because you already
have a LDAP server, a .htaccess file or if you store your passwords in another
table, you can provide your own `authenticate` callable (static method or
function) in `app.yml`:

    [yml]
    all:
      sf_easy_auth:
        authenticate_callable: [MyLDAPClass, checkPassword]

Symfony will call your method or function to check that the supplied details
are valid. Your function must take 2 parameters, the first
one is the username and the second one is the password. It must return true
or false. Here is a template for such a function:

    [php]
    function checkLDAPPassword($username, $password)
    {
      $user = LDAP::getUser($username);
      if ($user->checkPassword($password))
      {
        return true;
      }
      else
      {
        return false;
      }
    }

Adding more user types
----------------------

To add more user types, simply edit the app.yml file, adding more entries under 
`schema_inheritance`. E.g to add an `editor` user type, simply add an entry as below:

    [yml]
    schema_inheritance:                   # Credential inheritance definition for the plugin. 
      - admin: sfEasyAuthAdmin            # These values will be inserted into the schema. 
      - basicUser: sfEasyAuthBasicUser    # Keys are credential names, values are authentication 
      - editor: sfEasyAuthEditor          # classes.
            
Any users that are created as editors will automatically acquire the `editor` credential
when they log in.
        
All users inherit from a common superclass, but a hierarchy can easily be created by 
changing which model classes inherit from which others. Any class inheriting from any
other sfEasyAuthUser class will automatically acquire the credentials of its parent classes,
e.g.:

    [plain]
    super class: sfEasyAuthUser
    class sfEasyAuthAdmin extends sfEasyAuthUser              # has credential `admin`
    class sfEasyAuthBasicUser extends sfEasyAuthUser          # has credential `basicUser`
    class sfEasyAuthTrustedUser extends sfEasyAuthBasicUser   # has credentials `trustedUser`
                                                              # and `basicUser`
                                                              
This approach allows you to define the action associated with a credential in the model
instead of with groups and permissions in the database. For example `basicUsers` may be 
able to post blog comments, and `trustedUsers` may be able to edit them. Simply setting
the credentials required in your `security.yml` file on the appropriate actions would then
apply the restrictions, saving potentially costly database queries.

User profiles
-------------

Extra data about users can be stored in a profile. As with other parts of Symfony, 
convention is used instead of configuration. To create a profile for a user type, do
the following:

  * If your classes are prefixed by a string of characters to act as a namespace,
    edit the `profile_prefix` plugin app constant. These characters will be used to
    compute the name of the profile class.
    
  * Edit your main schema.yml file, creating an object with the same name as a user
    type with 'Profile' at the end. 
      e.g. if we declare an `editor` type as above and have a profile_prefix of 'my', 
      add something similar to below to your main `schema.yml` file:
    
    [plain]
    my_editor_profile:
      id: ~
      name: { type: varchar(200), required: true }
      articles_edited: { type: int, default: 0 }
      
    When you rebuild your model, you'll have a MyEditorProfile class and peer class in 
    your main model directory. You can retrieve the profile as follows:
    
    [php]
    echo $sf_user->getAuthUser()->getProfile()->getName() . ' has edited ' . 
      $sf_user->getAuthUser()->getProfile()->getArticlesEdited() . ' articles';
      
    or more simply:
    
    [php]
    echo $sf_user->getProfile()->getName() . ' has edited ' . 
      $sf_user->getProfile()->getArticlesEdited() . ' articles'; 
      
If you want to add more methods to the sfEasyAuthUserPeer class, it'd be better to 
create a sub-class of it, and store your sub-class in your main lib directory somewhere.
This will ease your upgrade path in future should you choose to. 

I18n
----

All error messages in templates can use the i18n framework. To enable translation of 
error messages in actions, make sure you enable the I18n module in your `settings.yml` file.
Then change the value of sf_easy_auth_use_i18n to true in your `app.yml` file.

Acknowledgements
----------------

Writing this plugin was made significantly easier thanks to sfGuardPlugin. Large parts of 
this documentation come directly from the documentation for that plugin, and some code was
based on code in that plugin too. Thanks to the developers of that plugin.

TODO
----

  * Add a password reminder - in progress
  * Think of an easy way for admins to manage extra credentials
  * Support user profiles for users with extra credentials that are related to those
    extra credentials
  * Clean up allowing users to configure destinations after logging in.
